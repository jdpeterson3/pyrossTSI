## About


[PyRoss](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross) is a companion library that offers tools for both deterministic and stochastic simulation of macroscopic compartmental models, as well as a complete
suite of inference and optimal control tools.


[PyRossGeo](https://github.com/lukastk/PyRossGeo) is a companion library that supports **spatially resolved compartment models** with explicit **commuting networks**.
